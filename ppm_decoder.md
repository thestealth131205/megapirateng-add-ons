# PPM Decoder #

Add-ons build includes replaced PPM\_SUM decoder running for both AIO v1 and v2 boards.

The decoder was fully rewritten at the time of some rapid in flight disarms reported somewhere near rev300 of the original mpNG code.

The best what you may get from this mod is when joint with sonar disable mod.
This config (PPM decoder + sonar disable) decreases CPU load a lot.

I am not sure, but it could be, that's why I have no reports on disarming using this build (valid for v1 boards only using PPM\_SUM on A8 pin and sonar disabled).

Anyway ... for other boards you may benefit from some faster work and variables optimisation.
