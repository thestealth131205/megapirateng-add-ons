Release History for MPNG-Add-Ons
--------------------------------------------------
2013-07-01  MegaPirateNG Add-Ons V2.9.1b R8.158
	Updated to Arducopter 2.9.1b final
		Improvements over 2.9.1:
		1) reduce default INS_MPU6K_FILTER to 20hz
		2) reduce InertialNav Z-axis time constant to 5 (was 7)
		3) increased max InertialNav accel correction to 3 m/s (was 1m/s)
		4) bug fix for alt_hold being passed as int16_t to get_throttle_althold_with_slew
		5) bug fix for throttle after acro flip (was being kept at min throttle if pilot switched out of ACRO mode while inverted)
		6) reduce yaw_rate P default to 0.20 (was 0.25)
		7) prevent cli from being entered more than 20seconds after reboot
		(based on original AC read.me)
