**Some Add-Ons & Gadgets for megapirateNG project**

(megapierateNG port of the ArduCopter 2.9.1  **plus some mods** )

The project cover some extension to the original mpNG code. It's based on community needs & help from a number of people who helped me. Thanks guys :)

Follow wiki pages for mods documentation.

  * Main trunk is the latest version.
  * Look into the Download section for zipped sources
  * LatestBETA branch is the latest Beta code currently in the development.

Whole project is Eclipse and Cygwin ready. But you still need Arduino libs to build.
It's running under Arduino as usually as well.

From time to time the newest original mpNG or ArduCopter code will be merged for compatibility.

Look into the SVN log for details.

**This is the open project, if you would like to participate in any kind pls contact me**

You will easily find me on RCGroups.

Have fun,
